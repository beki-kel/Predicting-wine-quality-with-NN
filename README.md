# Simple Neural Network

This repository contains a basic implementation of a simple neural network. It includes a Jupyter notebook and a Python script for demonstrating and using the neural network.

## Files

- **`wine-quality-prediction/`**: Contains the implementation of the neural network class, including methods for forward propagation, backward propagation, training, and prediction with Python.

- **`NeuralNetworkDemo.ipynb`**: A Jupyter notebook that provides a step-by-step demonstration of how to use the neural network.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features and target values for predicting wine quality.

- **Dataset Location**: Download the dataset (winequality-red.csv) and place it in the root directory of the project.

## Usage

1. **Python Script (`wine-quality-prediction/`):**
   - These scripts are for clarity purposes only. They define the neural network class and methods.
   - For a better experience, use the Jupyter notebook provided.

2. **Jupyter Notebook (`NeuralNetworkDemo.ipynb`):**
   - Open the notebook in Jupyter to view interactive examples and explanations.
   - The notebook includes cells for:
     - Defining the neural network
     - Loading and normalizing data
     - Training the neural network
     - Making predictions
     - Evaluating performance

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for the `.ipynb` file)
